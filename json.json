 //IIFE loads JSON file and returns the array of objects.
//Global variable augmented by the iifes is "chatty"
//The json file will have five messages in it.
/*Messages

When the page is first loaded, you must load 5 messages from a local JSON file 
and pre-fill a message area <div> below the input field that will also hold all new messages as they get created.
When the user presses the return key in the message field, the new message should be inserted into the message area.
The message should have a button displayed after it with the text "Delete" inside of it.
When the delete button next to a message is clicked, only that message should be removed from the DOM.*/
